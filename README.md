Advanced autonomous systems grapher and calculator.

Modeling and simulation project (check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeling_and_simulation) that graphs dynamic continuous autonomous systems in all the dimensions up to three.

It also measures some indicators and performs some practical calculations about the models.
